## 🧠 Consciousness-Quantum Integration Methodology

### Consciousness Features Quantification

The research quantifies consciousness through six primary dimensions:

```python
@dataclass
class ConsciousnessFeatures:
    empathy_level: float          # [0.0, 1.0] - Task empathy understanding
    intuition_strength: float     # [0.0, 1.0] - Intuitive decision capability
    analytical_depth: float       # [0.0, 1.0] - Analytical reasoning strength
    creative_potential: float     # [0.0, 1.0] - Creative problem-solving
    meditation_experience: float  # [0.0, 1.0] - Self-improvement capability
    emotional_intelligence: float # [0.0, 1.0] - Emotional context understanding
```

### Quantum State Conversion

Consciousness features are converted to quantum state vectors:

1. **Normalization**: Features normalized to unit vector
2. **Complexification**: Real features mapped to complex quantum amplitudes
3. **Superposition**: 8-dimensional quantum state space (2³ states)
4. **Entanglement**: Tasks quantum entangled based on consciousness empathy

### Consciousness Evolution Through Meditation

```python
def meditate(self, meditation_depth: float = 0.1) -> None:
    """Quantum meditation to evolve consciousness"""
    self.meditation_cycles += 1
    
    # Meditation enhances consciousness features
    self.consciousness_features.empathy_level += meditation_depth * 0.05
    self.consciousness_features.intuition_strength += meditation_depth * 0.03
    self.consciousness_features.meditation_experience += meditation_depth * 0.1
    
    # Update quantum state vector
    self.quantum_state_vector = self.consciousness_features.to_quantum_vector()
```
