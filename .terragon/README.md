# Terragon Autonomous SDLC System

> **Perpetual Value Discovery Edition**

An advanced autonomous Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) system that continuously discovers, prioritizes, and executes the highest-value work items using adaptive AI-driven decision making.

## 🎯 Overview

The Terragon Autonomous SDLC system transforms any repository into a self-improving, value-maximizing development environment through:

- **Continuous Value Discovery**: Multi-source signal harvesting from code, issues, security scans, and performance metrics
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Hybrid scoring using WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First), ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease), and Technical Debt models
- **Autonomous Execution**: Self-contained task execution with automatic rollback and quality gates
- **Perpetual Learning**: Continuous adaptation based on execution outcomes and feedback loops

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. System Status Check

```bash
python3 .terragon/terragon_scheduler.py --mode status
```

### 2. Discovery Mode (Update Backlog)

```bash
python3 .terragon/terragon_scheduler.py --mode discover
```

### 3. Single Execution Cycle

```bash
python3 .terragon/terragon_scheduler.py --mode single
```

### 4. Continuous Autonomous Mode

```bash
python3 .terragon/terragon_scheduler.py --mode continuous --max-cycles 10
```

### 5. Claude-Flow Swarm Integration

```bash
.terragon/terragon_swarm_command.sh
```

## 📊 Value Scoring Models

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
```
WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Size

Cost of Delay = User Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction + Opportunity Enablement
```

### ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
```
ICE = Impact × Confidence × Ease

All factors scored 1-10, resulting in max score of 1000
```

### Technical Debt Scoring
```
Debt Score = (Debt Impact + Debt Interest) × Hotspot Multiplier

Includes maintenance cost, future growth penalty, and code churn analysis
```

### Composite Score (Adaptive by Repository Maturity)

**Maturing Repository Weights** (Current):
- WSJF: 60%
- ICE: 10% 
- Technical Debt: 20%
- Security: 10%

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Repository Maturity Assessment

The system automatically adapts to repository maturity:

- **Nascent** (0-25%): Foundational elements (README, .gitignore, basic CI)
- **Developing** (25-50%): Enhanced testing, CI/CD foundation, security basics
- **Maturing** (50-75%): Advanced testing, comprehensive security, operational excellence
- **Advanced** (75%+): Optimization, modernization, governance

### Value Discovery Sources

- Git history analysis (TODO/FIXME markers)
- Static analysis (ruff, mypy, eslint)
- Security scanning (bandit, safety, npm audit)
- Dependency updates (pip list --outdated, renovate)
- Code comments (TODO, FIXME, HACK patterns)
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation staleness
- Performance bottlenecks

### Quality Gates

All autonomous changes must pass:
- ✅ Unit tests
- ✅ Linting (ruff, eslint)
- ✅ Type checking (mypy, tsc)
- ✅ Security scanning
- ✅ Build process
- ✅ Integration tests (if available)

## 🧠 Learning & Adaptation

### Prediction Accuracy Tracking
- Effort estimation vs. actual execution time
- Value prediction vs. actual business impact
- Success rate by category and complexity

- Confidence adjustment for prediction models
- Category-specific learning patterns
- False positive reduction strategies

### Feedback Loops

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Discovery finds no items**:

- Verify repository has discoverable patterns
- Review minimum score thresholds in config

**Execution failures**:
- Check quality gate configuration
- Verify required tools are installed
- Review rollback logs for specific failures

**Learning not improving**:
- Ensure sufficient execution history (>10 items)
- Check calibration schedule and execution
- Review pattern matching logic

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check system status
python3 .terragon/terragon_scheduler.py --mode status

# Verbose discovery
python3 .terragon/value_discovery_engine.py

# Learning report
python3 .terragon/learning_engine.py

# Manual execution
