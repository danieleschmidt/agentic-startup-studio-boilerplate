## üîß Implementation Requirements

### 1. Required Secrets Configuration

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):

```bash
# Container Registry (Automatic)
GITHUB_TOKEN                 # Provided by GitHub

# External Services (Optional)
SNYK_TOKEN                   # For enhanced vulnerability scanning
GRAFANA_API_TOKEN           # For monitoring dashboard updates
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL           # For notification integration

# Cloud Deployment (Choose your provider)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID           # AWS deployment credentials
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY       # AWS deployment credentials
AZURE_CREDENTIALS           # Azure service principal
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS          # GCP service account
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
