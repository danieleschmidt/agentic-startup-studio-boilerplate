  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Custom validation step
      run: |
        echo "Running custom validation..."
        # Add your custom logic here
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

```yaml
# Configure different environments
environment:
  name: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'production' || 'staging' }}
