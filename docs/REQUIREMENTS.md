- **NFR-4.2**: Automated backup and recovery procedures
- **NFR-4.3**: Health checks and monitoring integration

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **TC-1**: Must support Python 3.9+ for CrewAI compatibility
- **TC-2**: React 18+ for modern frontend features
- **TC-3**: Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- **TC-4**: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning

### Business Constraints
- **BC-1**: Open source license (Apache 2.0)
- **BC-2**: Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **BC-3**: Minimal external dependencies for core functionality

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions
- **A-1**: Users have Docker and basic development tools installed
- **A-2**: Cloud provider accounts (AWS/GCP/Azure) available for IaC
- **A-3**: Users understand basic Git workflows

### Dependencies
- **D-1**: CrewAI framework for agent orchestration
- **D-2**: FastAPI for backend API development
- **D-3**: React ecosystem for frontend development
- **D-4**: Terraform for infrastructure automation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **R-1**: CrewAI framework stability and breaking changes
- **R-2**: Complex multi-service Docker orchestration
- **R-3**: Terraform state conflicts in multi-developer teams

### Medium Risk
- **R-4**: Authentication integration complexity
- **R-5**: Cloud provider service availability
- **R-6**: Template variable configuration errors

### Low Risk
- **R-7**: Frontend component library updates
- **R-8**: Documentation maintenance overhead
