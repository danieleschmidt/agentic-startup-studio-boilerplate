# ADR-001: React Frontend Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-27

## Context
We need to select a frontend framework for the Agentic Startup Studio boilerplate that provides:
- Rapid development capabilities
- Strong TypeScript support
- Modern component architecture
- Excellent developer experience
- Large ecosystem and community support
- AI/agent integration capabilities

## Decision
We have chosen React 18+ with TypeScript as our frontend framework.

## Rationale
1. **Ecosystem Maturity**: React has the largest ecosystem with extensive libraries and tools
2. **TypeScript Integration**: First-class TypeScript support for type safety
3. **Component Architecture**: Component-based architecture aligns with modern development practices
4. **Performance**: React 18+ features like Concurrent Rendering improve performance
5. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling, debugging, and development experience
6. **AI Integration**: Strong support for integrating AI/ML models and APIs
7. **Team Expertise**: Widespread knowledge and expertise in the development community

## Alternatives Considered
- **Vue.js**: Simpler learning curve but smaller ecosystem
- **Angular**: More opinionated but heavier framework
- **Svelte**: Excellent performance but smaller community
- **Next.js**: Considered for SSR but decided on flexibility for SPA/SSR choice

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fast development with extensive component libraries
- Strong TypeScript support for better code quality
- Large talent pool for hiring
- Excellent testing frameworks (Jest, Testing Library)
- Great integration with modern build tools (Vite)

### Negative
- Bundle size can be larger than alternatives
- Rapid ecosystem changes require staying updated
- Potential over-engineering for simple applications

## Implementation Details
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for server state management
- Zustand for client state management
- Shadcn/UI for component library

## Compliance
This decision supports our requirements for:
- Rapid prototyping
- Type safety
- Modern development practices
- AI/agent integration capabilities
