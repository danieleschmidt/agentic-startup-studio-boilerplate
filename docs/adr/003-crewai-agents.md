# ADR-003: CrewAI Agent Orchestration

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-27

## Context
We need an agent orchestration framework for the Agentic Startup Studio that provides:
- Multi-agent coordination capabilities
- Task delegation and workflow management
- Integration with various LLM providers
- Scalable agent communication patterns
- Easy agent definition and management
- Production-ready stability

## Decision
We have chosen CrewAI as our primary agent orchestration framework.

## Rationale
1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Built specifically for coordinating multiple AI agents
2. **Workflow Management**: Sophisticated task delegation and result aggregation
3. **LLM Agnostic**: Works with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
4. **Python Integration**: Seamless integration with our FastAPI backend
5. **Production Ready**: Designed for production deployments with monitoring
6. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive agent definition and workflow creation
7. **Community**: Growing ecosystem and active development

## Alternatives Considered
- **LangChain**: More general-purpose, less specialized for multi-agent scenarios
- **AutoGen**: Microsoft's framework, but less mature ecosystem
- **Custom Solution**: Too much development overhead for complex orchestration
- **TaskWeaver**: Limited multi-agent coordination capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Sophisticated multi-agent workflows out of the box
- Built-in agent communication patterns
- Easy integration with various AI models
- Production monitoring and debugging capabilities
- Scalable architecture for complex agent interactions

### Negative
- Newer framework with evolving API
- Learning curve for agent orchestration concepts
- Dependency on framework development roadmap

## Implementation Details
- CrewAI for agent orchestration
- Agent roles: Researcher, Analyst, Writer, Validator, etc.
- Task-based workflow definition
- Result aggregation and validation
- Integration with FastAPI endpoints

## Agent Architecture
```python
# Example agent definition
researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Gather comprehensive information on given topics",
    backstory="Expert researcher with access to various data sources",
    tools=[web_search, database_query],
    verbose=True
)

analyst = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst", 
    goal="Analyze and synthesize research findings",
    backstory="Experienced analyst capable of finding patterns",
    tools=[data_analysis, visualization],
    verbose=True
)
```

## Communication Patterns
- Sequential task execution
- Parallel agent processing
- Result validation and feedback loops
- Error handling and recovery

## Monitoring and Observability
- Agent performance metrics
- Task completion tracking
- Error monitoring and alerting
- Resource usage monitoring

## Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal agent scaling
- Resource pooling for LLM calls
- Caching for repeated operations
- Rate limiting for external APIs

## Compliance
This decision supports our requirements for:
- Sophisticated AI agent coordination
- Scalable multi-agent workflows
- Production monitoring capabilities
- Flexible LLM integration
