# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Agentic Startup Studio project. ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project's development.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a lightweight way to document architectural decisions. Each ADR describes:
- The context and problem statement
- The decision made
- The rationale behind the decision
- The consequences (both positive and negative)

## Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: Background and problem statement
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](001-react-frontend.md) | React Frontend Framework Selection | Accepted | 2025-07-27 |
| [002](002-fastapi-backend.md) | FastAPI Backend Framework | Accepted | 2025-07-27 |
| [003](003-crewai-agents.md) | CrewAI Agent Orchestration | Accepted | 2025-07-27 |
| [004](004-postgresql-database.md) | PostgreSQL Database Selection | Accepted | 2025-07-27 |
| [005](005-kubernetes-orchestration.md) | Kubernetes Container Orchestration | Accepted | 2025-07-27 |

## Guidelines for New ADRs

When creating a new ADR:

1. **Use the next sequential number** in the filename (e.g., `006-new-decision.md`)
2. **Follow the established format** for consistency
3. **Be specific and concrete** in your descriptions
4. **Consider alternatives** and document why they were rejected
5. **Update this README** to include the new ADR in the table above

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: The ADR is under discussion
- **Accepted**: The decision has been made and is being implemented
- **Deprecated**: The decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by a newer ADR
