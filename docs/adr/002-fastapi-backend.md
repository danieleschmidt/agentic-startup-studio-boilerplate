# ADR-002: FastAPI Backend Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-27

## Context
We need a backend framework for the Agentic Startup Studio that provides:
- High performance for AI/agent workloads
- Automatic API documentation
- Modern Python async/await support
- Type safety and validation
- Easy integration with AI/ML libraries
- Rapid development capabilities

## Decision
We have chosen FastAPI with Python 3.11+ as our backend framework.

## Rationale
1. **Performance**: One of the fastest Python frameworks, comparable to Node.js
2. **Automatic Documentation**: Built-in OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
3. **Type Safety**: Native Pydantic integration for request/response validation
4. **Async Support**: First-class async/await support for handling concurrent requests
5. **AI Integration**: Excellent integration with Python AI/ML libraries (CrewAI, LangChain, etc.)
6. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API design and excellent error messages
7. **Modern Standards**: Built on modern Python standards (type hints, async/await)

## Alternatives Considered
- **Django**: Too heavy for API-first applications
- **Flask**: Lacks modern async support and built-in validation
- **Express.js**: Different language, less AI/ML ecosystem integration
- **Tornado**: Lower-level, more complex for rapid development

## Consequences

### Positive
- High performance for AI agent workloads
- Automatic API documentation reduces maintenance
- Strong type safety prevents runtime errors
- Excellent async performance for I/O-bound operations
- Easy integration with Python AI/ML ecosystem

### Negative
- Newer framework with smaller community than Django/Flask
- Some third-party packages may not support async patterns
- Requires understanding of async/await concepts

## Implementation Details
- FastAPI with Python 3.11+
- Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- SQLAlchemy ORM with async support
- Alembic for database migrations
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Redis for caching and session storage

## Security Considerations
- Built-in request validation prevents injection attacks
- OAuth2/JWT integration for authentication
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Rate limiting for API protection

## Performance Characteristics
- Target: 95th percentile response time under 200ms
- Concurrent request handling with async workers
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data

## Compliance
This decision supports our requirements for:
- High-performance AI agent orchestration
- Rapid API development
- Type-safe code
- Automatic documentation generation
