# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Template

## Context
We need a consistent format for documenting architectural decisions to maintain clarity and traceability throughout the project lifecycle.

## Decision
We will use the following template for all Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short descriptive title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [What becomes easier or better after this change?]

### Negative
- [What becomes more difficult or worse after this change?]

### Neutral
- [What are the trade-offs or neutral impacts?]

## Alternatives Considered
- [What other options were considered?]
- [Why were they not chosen?]

## References
- [Links to relevant documents, RFCs, or external resources]
```

## Consequences
### Positive
- Consistent documentation format across all architectural decisions
- Clear decision context and rationale preserved for future reference
- Structured evaluation of alternatives and consequences

### Negative
- Additional documentation overhead for each architectural decision
- Requires discipline to maintain and update ADRs

### Neutral
- Standard format may not fit all decision types perfectly
