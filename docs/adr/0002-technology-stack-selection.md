# ADR-0002: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a technology stack that enables rapid development of agentic startups while maintaining production-grade quality, scalability, and maintainability.

## Decision
We will use the following core technology stack:

**Backend:**
- Python 3.9+ with FastAPI for REST APIs
- CrewAI for agent orchestration and AI workflows
- Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- SQLAlchemy for database ORM
- Alembic for database migrations

**Frontend:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- Shadcn UI for component library
- Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching and session storage

**Development Tools:**
- Cookiecutter for project templating
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- pytest for Python testing
- Jest for JavaScript testing
- Playwright for end-to-end testing

## Consequences
### Positive
- Modern, well-supported frameworks with active communities
- Type safety across both frontend and backend
- Excellent developer experience with hot reload and debugging
- Production-ready infrastructure automation
- Strong ecosystem for AI/ML integration

### Negative
- Steep learning curve for teams unfamiliar with the stack
- Multiple languages and frameworks increase complexity
- CrewAI framework is relatively new with potential breaking changes

### Neutral
- Standard web development patterns apply
- Good documentation available for all components

## Alternatives Considered
- **Django + Vue.js**: More traditional but less modern developer experience
- **Node.js + Express**: Single language but less robust for AI workloads
- **LangChain instead of CrewAI**: More mature but less startup-focused
- **Angular instead of React**: Good but larger learning curve and complexity
