# ADR-003: CrewAI Agent Orchestration Framework

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Authors**: Daniel Schmidt  
**Reviewers**: Terragon Labs Team  

## Context

The agentic startup studio boilerplate requires a robust framework for orchestrating multiple AI agents that can collaborate, delegate tasks, and manage complex workflows. The solution must support both simple single-agent scenarios and complex multi-agent coordination patterns.

## Decision

We will use CrewAI as the primary agent orchestration framework for the following reasons:

### Technical Advantages
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Native support for agent collaboration patterns
- **Task Management**: Built-in task delegation and workflow management
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for custom agent types and tools
- **Python Integration**: Seamless integration with FastAPI backend
- **Memory Management**: Persistent agent state and context management

### Business Benefits
- **Rapid Development**: Pre-built patterns for common agent scenarios
- **Community Support**: Active open-source community and documentation
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade features and monitoring
- **Cost Effective**: Open-source with commercial support options

## Implementation

### Architecture Components
```python
# Core agent structure
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str, role: str, tools: List[Tool]):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role
        self.tools = tools
    
    async def execute_task(self, task: Task) -> TaskResult:
        # Agent execution logic
        pass

# Crew coordination
class AgentCrew:
    def __init__(self, agents: List[BaseAgent], workflow: WorkflowConfig):
        self.agents = agents
        self.workflow = workflow
    
    async def execute(self, objective: str) -> CrewResult:
        # Orchestration logic
        pass
```

### Integration Points
- **FastAPI Endpoints**: RESTful API for agent interaction
- **Database Integration**: SQLAlchemy models for agent state persistence
- **Message Queues**: Redis for inter-agent communication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics for agent performance tracking

### Configuration Management
```yaml
# agents.yml
agents:
  research_agent:
    role: "Senior Researcher"
    goal: "Conduct comprehensive research and analysis"
    backstory: "Expert in information gathering and synthesis"
    tools: [web_search, document_analysis, data_extraction]
  
  writing_agent:
    role: "Content Writer"
    goal: "Create compelling and accurate content"
    backstory: "Professional writer with technical expertise"
    tools: [content_generation, grammar_check, formatting]
```

## Alternatives Considered

### LangGraph
- **Pros**: More flexible graph-based workflows, better for complex state machines
- **Cons**: More complex setup, less documentation, steeper learning curve
- **Decision**: Too complex for rapid startup development

### AutoGen
- **Pros**: Microsoft backing, good conversational agent patterns
- **Cons**: Less flexible orchestration, limited production features
- **Decision**: Better for research than production systems

### Custom Framework
- **Pros**: Complete control, tailored to specific needs
- **Cons**: High development overhead, maintenance burden, reinventing patterns
- **Decision**: Not aligned with rapid development goals

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster Development**: Pre-built agent patterns accelerate development
- **Proven Architecture**: Battle-tested orchestration patterns
- **Community Support**: Active community for troubleshooting and extensions
- **Scalability**: Built-in support for scaling agent workloads

### Negative
- **Framework Lock-in**: Dependency on CrewAI's architectural decisions
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn CrewAI-specific patterns
- **Version Management**: Need to stay current with framework updates

### Risk Mitigation
- **Abstraction Layer**: Implement adapter pattern for easier migration
- **Version Pinning**: Use specific versions with comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: Maintain internal docs for customizations and patterns
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive agent performance monitoring

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
- [ ] Install and configure CrewAI
- [ ] Create base agent templates
- [ ] Implement basic crew orchestration
- [ ] Add FastAPI integration endpoints

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement agent memory persistence
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create custom tool integrations
- [ ] Build workflow configuration system

### Phase 3: Production Hardening
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Agents can be deployed and executed within 5 minutes of project setup
- [ ] Multi-agent workflows complete successfully with >95% reliability
- [ ] Agent performance metrics are collected and visualized
- [ ] Custom agent types can be added without framework modifications
- [ ] System scales to handle 100+ concurrent agent tasks
